# cs2d_updater 

A simple tool to update CS2D. Please take into account that I don't play CS2D at all, I just wanted to write an updater that works a bit better than the one that's in the game already for fun. I can't help you with any cs2d issues and I won't.

## Instructions
* Copy config.py.example to config.py
* Open config.py and edit lines as described in config
* Start python script using py3

You can also just leave the cs2d_path at "None", if you put the script in the game directory
